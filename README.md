# GroundSeg3D
GroundSeg3D is an advanced ground segmentation algorithm designed for all-terrain use. This method demonstrates robust performance across various open-source datasets, including SemanticKITTI, RELLIS-3D, UrbanNav, DOALS, and BotanicGarden, without needing parameter adjustments. A video preview highlights its adaptability and effectiveness. The corresponding research paper has been submitted for ICRA 2025, and the code will be made open-source post-publication.
